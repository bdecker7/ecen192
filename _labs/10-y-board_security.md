## Overview:
This lab will introduce you to basic de-hashing and the CIA triangle. 
Background/Preparation:
In the last lab, you should have registered an account on the Y-Badge webpage. Log in to ensure you have this done. Find a partner and remain with them for the duration of the lab. NOTE: This lab must be done on-campus, and devices should be connected to the Wi-Fi called _____.
Open this webpage: _____. Follow along with this video: _____.

### Equipment and Materials:
- Y-Badge
- LED screen
- Computer or Phone

## Procedure:

### Step 1: Webpage Exploration
1. Turn on Y-Badge 
2. Open Y-Badge webpage and log in
3. Explore the site, click things
4. Click on Y-Badge button on webpage
5. Look to your LED screen to find your IP address and password
6. Change the color of your Y-Badge LEDs

### Step 2: Webpage Exploitation
1. Enter /robots.txt at the end of the domain (i.e. cloudflare.com/robots.txt)
2. Look for suspicious pages
        a. Hint: Explore the disallowed pages

### Step 3: Breach of Confidentiality (seeing something you shouldn’t see)
1. Find the IP address of your partner on their LED screen
    a. Hint: Consider “shoulder-surfing” their LED screen
2. Input your partner’s IP address to receive their password hash
3. Use one of the following tools to reveal the hashed password: 
    a. DCode
    b. Hashes

### Step 4: Breach of Integrity (changing something that you shouldn’t change)
1. Return to the Y-Badge section of the webpage
2. Input your partner’s Y-Badge IP address and the password you de-hashed
3. Change the LED colors of your partner’s badge

### Step 5: Challenges
1. Scour the webpage to find easter eggs to send to your partner’s Y-Badge 
    a. Hint: Consider checking other endpoints and disallowed paths

### Optional Post-Lab Work:
Show your friend or roommate your project and quickly explain to them how it works. Answer any questions they have to the best of your ability and be prepared to report in class.
The webpage and Y-Badges will be functional across BYU campus. Continue searching for easter eggs using the steps we followed.
